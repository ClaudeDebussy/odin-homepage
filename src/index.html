      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Achille-Claude Debussy, a composer who believes that music is not
        merely a set of rules to be followed, but a colorful, fluid expression
        of nature and emotion. Often described as the first Impressionist
        composer, I strive to break free from the rigid structures of
        traditional harmony. My work seeks to capture fleeting moments,
        shimmering light, and the subtle rhythms of the natural world. I compose
        not to resolve chords, but to give pleasure and to liberate the
        imagination.
